    "body": "# Scratch in the Linux kernel\r\nScratch is well-accepted by many to be the best programming language ever. Despite this, the Linux kernel has absolutely no Scratch in it! The advantages to Scratch in the kernel are clear:\r\n- Accessibility\r\n  \r\n    With the Linux kernel written in Scratch, more people will be able to contribute to Linux. \"Programming\" \"languages\" like C and Rust are based of the assumption that everyone is a dev. This assumption is simply false. \r\n- Speed\r\n  \r\n    While Scratch itself is slow, with the help of Turbowarp, it can be BLAZINGLY fast, by compiling Scratch to Javascript. This has the added benefit of allowing web developers to be able to more easily contribute to the kernel.\r\n- Simplicity\r\n  \r\n    Scratch is simply cleaner. Code like ``printf(\"Hello, world!\\n\");`` is simply bloated. In Scratch, it's as simple as ``say \"Hello, world!\"``. You don't have to worry about anything complex like the \"terminal\" or \"types,\" whatever those are.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these, I have rewritten part of rust/kernel/time.rs in Scratch, and am starting the inclusion of Scratch in the kernel. Perhaps one day, we can rewrite the entire kernel in Scratch, and get all of these benefits without worrying about interoperability with C.\r\n\r\n## Request for comments\r\nAll comments will be added to the list ``COMMENTS``, in a project with the following code in the stage:\r\n```\r\nwhen [flag clicked]\r\nforever {\r\n  delete all of list [COMMENTS]\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "Grace Hopper/Blackwell systems support the Extended GPU Memory (EGM)\r\nfeature that enable the GPU to access the system memory within and\r\nacross nodes. The GPU can allocate the system memory located on the\r\nsame socket or from a different socket or even on a different\r\nnode in a multi-node system [1]. The feature is being extended to\r\nvirtualization.\r\n\r\nEGM when enabled in the virtualization stack, the host memory\r\nis partitioned into two: One partition for the Host OS usage, and\r\na second EGM region that is assigned to the VM. The EGM region\r\nessentially becomes the system memory of the VM.\r\n\r\nThe EGM/VM region is not available to the host memory for its usage\r\nas it is not added to the kernel. Its base SPA and the length is\r\ncommunicated through the DSDT entries. A linear mapping between the\r\nVM IPA and system SPA is a requirement for EGM support. The EGM region\r\nis thus assigned to a VM by mapping the QEMU VMA to a linearly\r\nincreasing HPA of the EGM region using remap_pfn_range().\r\n\r\nPatch 1-4 makes changes to the nvgrace-gpu module to fetch the\r\nEGM information and create EGM regions tracking the information. It\r\nalso creates and auxiliary device to be managed byt the nvgrace-egm\r\nauxiliary module.\r\nPath 5-10 introduce the new nvgrace-egm module to manage the EGM\r\nregion. The module implements a char device to expose the EGM to\r\nusermode apps such as QEMU. The module does a linear mapping of\r\nthe QEMU VMA to the EGM HPA using remap_pfn range.\r\nPatch 11-12 fetches the list of pages on EGM with known ECC errors.\r\nPatch 13-14 expose the EGM topology and size through sysfs\r\n\r\nApplied over next-20250730 and using qemu repository [2]. Tested on the\r\nGrace Blackwell platform by booting up VM, loading NVIDIA module [2] and\r\nrunning nvidia-smi in the VM to check for the presence of EGM capability.\r\n\r\nTo run CUDA workloads, there is a dependency on the IOMMUFD and the\r\nNested Page Table patches being worked on separately by Nicolin Chen.\r\n(nicolinc@nvidia.com). NVIDIA has provided git repositories which\r\nincludes all the requisite kernel [3] and Qemu [4] patches in case\r\none wants to try.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Jason Gunthorpe, Vikram Sethi, Aniket Agashe for design\r\nsuggestions and Andy Currid, Neo Jia, Matt Ochs, Kirti Wankhede among\r\nothers for the review feedbacks.\r\n\r\nLink: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchip-architecture-in-depth/#extended_gpu_memory [1]\r\nLink: https://github.com/nicolinc/qemu/commits/wip/for_iommufd_veventq-v9 [2]\r\nLink: https://github.com/NVIDIA/NV-Kernels/tree/6.8_ghvirt [3]\r\nLink: https://github.com/NVIDIA/QEMU/tree/6.8_ghvirt_iommufd_vcmdq [4]",

These long lines can make the code harder to read, especially on standard terminals or when doing side-by-side code reviews.\n\nThis is my first contribution to the Linux kernel. I've carefully reviewed the documentation and followed the submission guidelines. Looking forward to your feedback.",

This is important so\r\ncallers can detect truncation.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces a total_len counter that accurately tracks the intended\r\noutput length regardless of buffer size. The final return value is now\r\ntotal_len instead of the number of characters that were successfully written.\r\n\r\nThis makes vsnprintf() standards-compliant while preserving existing\r\nbehavior for safely writing to bounded buffers.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Jake <jakecontactxyz@gmail.com)",
